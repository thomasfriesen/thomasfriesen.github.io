      <description>Classification is a supervised task for categorizing observation given a set of variables. The category for each observation is given before. This is similiar to regression but the response variable is now discrete. The most used case is a binary classification but a multi-case classification is possible too. A possible problem in classification is the case of an imbalanced dataset, where the number of cases are not equally distributed. To counter this problem a number of sampling methods can be used.</description>
